 *
 *  \section state-overview Run-state overview
 *
 *  A Task exists in one of four states:
 *  1. Uninitialized (`TASK_UNINITIALIZED`)
 *  2. Stopped (`TASK_STOPPED`)
 *  3. Started (`TASK_STARTED`)
 *  4. Running (`TASK_RUNNING`)
 *
 *  When the object is first created, it is in the uninitialized state.
 *  Here is the state table. The cell content is the new state. Blank cells
 *  mean the action is ignored.
 *
 *                     |--------------------Action------------------------------------------------------|
 * |---Current state---| initialize() | start() | beginAsync() | haltAsync() | stop()  | setIPAddress() |
 * |-------------------|--------------|---------|--------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
 * | uninitialized     | stopped      |         |              |             |         | uninitialized  |
 * | stopped           |              | started |              |             |         | uninitialized  |
 * | started           |              |         | running      |             | stopped |                |
 * | running           |              |         |              | started     | stopped |                |
 *
 *  The initialize() action ensures that the AVMU unit is online and
 *  is responding to commands.  It also downloads the hardware details from
 *  the unit needed to properly program the unit.

 *  The start() action programs the AVMU unit. At this stage the unit is able
 *  to respond to measurement commands.

 *  The stop() action idles the unit.

 *  The setIPAddress() action puts the state back to uninitialized, because
 *  the assumption is that a different VNA unit is going to be targeted.
 *  Hardware details can vary from unit to unit and so those details must be
 *  re-downloaded prior to programming the new unit.
 *  NOTE: any calibration data is marked invalid when the state transitions
 *  to uninitialized. If you would like to use the calibration on a different
 *  unit (or save it for later), see the exportCalibration() function.
