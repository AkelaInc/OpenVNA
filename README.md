## OpenVNA

This is the header-file for the Akela OpenVNA API.

Eventually (a week or so), this repository should also contain 32 & 64 bit 
.DLL/.SO dynamically-linkable libraries that the header file corresponds
to, but that will have to wait for a bit untill I can work out the 
best way to build multiple DLL types (32 & 64) simultaneously from the 
same build process.
